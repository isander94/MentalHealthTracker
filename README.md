# Mental Health Trakcer

The Mental Health Tracker App is designed to support individuals in tracking their daily activities and assessing their mood. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 3, particularly target 3.4, which aims to promote mental health and well-being, it provides a platform for users to journal their experiences throughout the day and reflect on their emotions. Users can input their activities, thoughts, and feelings, and rate their mood using a scoring system. This allows for self-reflection and awareness, helping users identify patterns in their behavior and emotions over time. While the app facilitates personal growth and mindfulness, it is important to note that it does not replace professional mental health care. Users are encouraged to seek professional help if needed for diagnosis, treatment, or support with mental health concerns.
